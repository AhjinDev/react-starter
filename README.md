# Starter Kit ReactJS (TypeScript/TailwindCSS/Recoil)

This starter kit is based on the `npx create-react-app starter-kit --template typescript` command.
We choose to implement [TailwindCSS](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) as the CSS Framework.

For the state management, we decide to use [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/fr/), a open source state management lib for React and created by Facebook.

The principle language is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it is useful for get less debug thanks to Types.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
