# Starter Kit ReactJS (TypeScript/TailwindCSS/Recoil)

This starter kit is based on the `npx create-react-app starter-kit --template typescript` command.\ [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We choose to implement [TailwindCSS](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) as the CSS Framework.

For the state management, we decide to use [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/fr/), a open source state management lib for React and created by Facebook.

The principle language is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it is useful to get less debug thanks to Types.
